            <h2>Move towards secure attachment</h2>
            <p>
                When we get all of our needs met as a child, we move through the world with wonder, confidence, self-love, and a deep connection to who we are and our purpose. 
                When we don't (which is true for so many of us), we carry the wounds of insecurity, fear, self-criticism, low self-esteem, and low self-confidence.
                <b>It is possible to meet the needs that didn't get met and move into secure attachment.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideal parent figure (IPF) is a therapy methodology that meets our childhood needs. 
                <b>A pilot study found that four 16-minute IPF visualizations each week for a month significantly reduced symptoms of people with complex PTSD.</b>
            <p>
                This program is designed to be a lot more than four 16-minute visualizations carried out over a month. We want to help you experience what you didn't think was possible (or did not even know you were missing), and help your nervous system learn a felt sense of security, safety, comfort, attunement, delight in your being, and support for exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a first pilot, built on what I've learned from all of my training, coaching clients, and running Ideal Mother & Father workshops. It is heavily influenced by the Ideal Parent Figure methodology, but also expands on it, weaving in parts work, the divine masculine and feminine, and energetic work.

                    <p>Hi, I'm Amanda.</p>
                    <p>I've been on a journey into my inner world for the last 8 years. During that time, I've explored every modality I can find – from traditional therapies like CBT and psychoanalysis, to somatic modalities like focusing and parts work, to awakening and energy healing.</p>
                    <p>Doing ideal parent figure was one of the first times I realized what it could feel like to get my needs met. </p>
                    <p><blockquote>I've been doing this therapy for 8 months. In that time, I've had many moments of deep, felt senses of relief. I've tasted what it's like to actually have unconditional love and a true belief that I am safe and cared for. I feel like Mary in the colorless room: Before, I could describe what security would feel like and point to moments where I had felt more secure. But what I've felt since starting IPF is like a different qualia that I couldn't have imagined before. I didn't possess the experiential building blocks to be able to imagine this feeling of security.</blockquote></p>
                    <p>I now coach people with a combination of ideal parent figure, parts work, and energy healing. Ideal parent figure has been so helpful for my clients, and I want to share that experience with more people.</p>
